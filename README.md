# Autonomous-Drone-Navigation-with-reinforcement-learning
Drone navigation involves the process of controlling the movement and flight path of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), encompassing both hardware and software systems for autonomous or operator-guided maneuvering. Its utility is vast across numerous industries.

# 🚀 Features

# Main Modules / Libraries Used
• gym (OpenAI Gym) — Environment API (Env, reset, step)
• stable-baselines3 (SB3) — RL algorithms (PPO) and utilities
• numpy — numerical arrays and math operations
• matplotlib — plotting trajectories, obstacles, results
• os, random — file handling and reproducibility
• torch (indirectly used by SB3) — backend for neural networks
