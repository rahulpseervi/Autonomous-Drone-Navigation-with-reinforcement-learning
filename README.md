# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning with PPO using Stable-Baselines3

This project demonstrates how to implement and train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** with the **Stable-Baselines3** library. The agent interacts with environments from **OpenAI Gym**, and results are visualized using **Matplotlib**.

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `gym` — Environment interface (e.g., `Env`, `reset()`, `step()`)
- `stable-baselines3` — RL algorithms and training utilities (PPO, DQN, etc.)
- `numpy` — Efficient numerical operations and array handling
- `matplotlib` — Visualization of training progress, trajectories, and environment states
- `os`, `random` — File handling and reproducibility
- `torch` — Backend for neural networks (used internally by SB3)

Install them via pip:

```bash
pip install gym stable-baselines3 numpy matplotlib torch
